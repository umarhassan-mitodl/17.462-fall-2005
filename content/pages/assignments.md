Students will be required to write one paper, and to present that paper to the seminar at the end of the semester. Depending on class size, auditors may be required to make presentations as well, though not to write papers. Students should meet with Prof. Sapolsky or Prof. Posen to develop suitable paper topics. Students should be encouraged by the fact that the literature on military innovation is underdeveloped. It tends to be discursive, atheoretical, and unsystematic. But, there is a wealth of case material available for exploitation in student essays and doctoral dissertations. For purposes of this seminar, single case studies or comparative case studies will likely prove the best format. We expect to see a substantial theoretical component in every paper.
